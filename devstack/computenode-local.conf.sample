# The DevStack plugin defaults to using the ovn branch from the official ovs
# repo.  You can optionally use a different one.  For example, you may want to
# use the latest patches in blp's ovn branch:
#OVN_REPO=http://github.com/blp/ovs-reviews.git
#OVN_BRANCH=origin/ovn

enable_service ovn-controller

# Set this to the address of the main DevStack host running the rest of the
# OpenStack services.
